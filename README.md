# 👋 Hi, I’m Ahmet Fatih Şahin (@ahmetfths)

🎓 I'm a pharmacist and a Ph.D. candidate in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery and Development.  
🧪 I specialize in **AI-driven molecular modeling**, **virtual screening**, and **ADMET filtering** for identifying promising drug candidates.  
🌍 I've conducted TÜBİTAK-funded research in Germany and collaborated with international teams on cutting-edge drug discovery projects.

## 👀 Interests
- Deep learning for drug discovery (e.g., QSAR, binding prediction, molecule generation)
- Virtual screening & molecular docking (e.g., Schrödinger, DeepDocking, Glide, Qvina)
- Molecular dynamics & free energy calculations
- Building in silico tools for rapid screening and compound prioritization
- Exploring the intersection of **pharmacology, AI, and software development**

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Large-scale ADMET filtering using ML models  
- Web-based molecular tools (Flask, React, Python backends)
- Local LLMs integration for molecule insights (e.g., Ollama)

## 🤝 Open to Collaborations On
- AI-powered drug screening platforms  
- Academic or industry-driven virtual screening projects  
- Tools that enhance **explainability in drug design**
